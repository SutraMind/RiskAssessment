# AI-Driven Risk Assessment Framework

This repository contains research on an AI-driven risk assessment framework that identifies security vulnerabilities directly from specification documents. By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), large language models (LLMs), and human-in-the-loop feedback, the framework enables proactive risk detection and mitigation throughout the software development lifecycle.
## ðŸš€ Attention! ðŸš€  

The workable product has been deployed in free web server. Please wait for the response for the first time because the free server takes time for the first time. Be patient.

Stay tuned for other interesting updates.

## Features

- **Early Risk Detection:** Analyze SRS documents and user stories to identify security vulnerabilities and design risks.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Combines precise small-chunk retrieval with the broader context of parent documents.
- **Modular & Scalable:** Designed to integrate with any state-of-the-art LLM or risk assessment model.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback:** Incorporates expert feedback to continuously refine and improve risk assessments.
- **Comprehensive Memory Management:** Utilizes both short-term and long-term memory strategies for enhanced decision-making.

## Repository Structure
