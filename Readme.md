# AI-Driven Risk Assessment Framework

This repository contains research on an AI-driven risk assessment framework that identifies security vulnerabilities directly from specification documents. By leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), large language models (LLMs), and human-in-the-loop feedback, the framework enables proactive risk detection and mitigation throughout the software development lifecycle.
## ðŸš€ Attention! ðŸš€  

The **full code** for the AI-Driven Risk Assessment Framework is coming **within 3 days (March 19th, 2025)!**  

Stay tuned for the release and be ready to explore an advanced system for security vulnerability detection using **RAG, LLMs, and human-in-the-loop feedback!**

## Features

- **Early Risk Detection:** Analyze SRS documents and user stories to identify security vulnerabilities and design risks.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation:** Combines precise small-chunk retrieval with the broader context of parent documents.
- **Modular & Scalable:** Designed to integrate with any state-of-the-art LLM or risk assessment model.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback:** Incorporates expert feedback to continuously refine and improve risk assessments.
- **Comprehensive Memory Management:** Utilizes both short-term and long-term memory strategies for enhanced decision-making.
